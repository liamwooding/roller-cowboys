# Roller Cowboys

## Top down synchronous turn-based shootouts

- Players aim both guns each turn
- All shots go off at the same time
- Shots kick the shooter backwards with enough force that they can be used for dodging incoming bullets
- If a player shoots in the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock directions, they will move in the 6 o'clock direction
- Direct hits kill
- Getting winged reduces a player to 1 gun for the next turn
- Bullets are destroyed on impact with most surfaces
- Bullets can ricochet (once) off some surfaces
- Bullets explode on contact with each other, sending nearby players rolling a long way, but causing no damage
  - This can be used to propel oneself quickly, by aiming both guns at a central point in front of the player
  - Should this explosion affect other bullets? Could be used as a shield in a pinch.
